# About

Hi, I'm Chris, a developer and platform engineer passionate about building scalable systems, automation, and developer experience. My work spans multiple languages and platforms, reflecting a hands-on approach to everything from infrastructure-as-code to automation scripts and productivity tooling.

My philosophy is pragmatic: automate what can be automated, document what matters, and always be learning. Whether it's scripting, backend development, or managing developer platforms, I enjoy building tools that empower others and myself.
