# About

Hi, I'm Chris, a developer and platform engineer passionate about building scalable systems, automation, and developer experience. My work spans multiple languages and platforms, reflecting a hands-on approach to everything from infrastructure-as-code to automation scripts and productivity tooling.

My open-source projects showcase a broad technical toolkit, including:
- **Platform automation & dotfiles:** [gitconfig](https://github.com/chrisjust/gitconfig) for custom Git setups, and [ubuntu-developer-machine](https://github.com/chrisjust/ubuntu-developer-machine) for rapid developer environment provisioning.
- **Development on multiple stacks:** I've delivered tools and apps in C#, Java, JavaScript, and Shell, such as [TaxCalculator](https://github.com/chrisjust/TaxCalculator) (C#), [FindPopularArtist](https://github.com/chrisjust/FindPopularArtist) (Java), and [electon-curved-corners](https://github.com/chrisjust/electon-curved-corners) (JavaScript).
- **Legacy and community stewardship:** I'm a maintainer of the [open-hardware-monitor](https://github.com/chrisjust/open-hardware-monitor) project, supporting legacy hardware monitoring codebases.

This is the home page. It can be used for a short introduction. [Click here](cv) to see the full CV, and [here](assets/files/cv.pdf) to download a print version. The theme also ships with a blog: [click here](posts) to scroll posts from the most recent. Finally, [click here](404) to see a page that can't be found.

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).

My philosophy is pragmatic: automate what can be automated, document what matters, and always be learning. Whether it's scripting, backend development, or managing developer platforms, I enjoy building tools that empower others and myself.
